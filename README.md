# Data-Analysis
#ETL - Extract Transform Load
During the first phase of the task I have loaded the given data and then the data is Transfomed / Manipulated in the Power Query Editor
#Designing the DATA MODEL
After the validation of the data , next goes with the data modelling where the data model is desined using the relationships.
#PIVOT_CHARTS & TABLES
In the given data ; the data is given in 3 different sheets and 3 different tables where the data is about "User_Data,Session_Data,Order_Data",By Working with ETL next the data is ready for the creating for "Pivot Tables" & "Pivot Graphs" . By Using these pivot charts I have developed the dashboard.
In one of the tables the USER_ID is the unique key in USER_DETAILS_TABLE and the same key is the foriegn key for the other two {SESSION_DETAILS_TABLE,ORDER_DETAILS_TABLE} tables with having no null values and having the unique values
The data that is provided is small scale data with minimum details and data 
#VISUALIZATON
During the developing of the Visualization I have gone through some trends and insights and I have performed some operations like "MAX,MIN,AVERAGE,COUNT,TOTAL,percentage,....some satistical operations to get insigts visually.
I got to know the data just by seeing the dashboard accoring to all the KPI's
#RECOMMENDATIONS :
The BreakFast Meal : Oat Meal is having the less rating compare to the other dishes present so that we need to work on the OatMeal session 
We need to try to acheive the 100% completed Order status in the Morning and Night Sessions.
I would recommend adding more number of dishes in the menu would become the key point to attract more users.
#OBSERVATIONS :
During the dinner the more user traffic is there and the peopele having their most favorite meal is in the dinner
In the day time after 13hrs (i.e 1:00pm) there is graduallly increase in the start of the sessions & In the Night period of time @ 19:00 hrs (i.e 7:00pm )the sessions are at high point.
